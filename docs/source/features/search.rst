Searching
=========

You can easily perform a research on Pornhub with :meth:`.Client.search`.

.. code-block:: python

    import phub

    client = phub.Client()
    query = client.search('my query')

Search filters
--------------

You can specify search filters by adding :py:class:`.Param` objects.
There is a list of constant Parameters you can import from ``phub.locals``.
You can see :doc:`here </api/locals>` a list of possible filters.

.. code-block:: python

    import phub
    from phub.locals import *

    client = phub.Client()
    query = client.search('my query', Category.FRENCH)

For instance, this query will be restrained to search in the French category.

You can use multiple Parameters objects by adding or subtracting them, e.g.:

.. warning::
  
    As of now, Pornhub only supports searching in one Category at a time.
    But you can still exclude as many as you want!

.. code-block:: python

    # Search in the French category for homemade production
    client.search(..., Category.FRENCH | Production.HOMEMADE)

    # Search for professional production, but exclude all BBW videos
    client.search(..., Production.PROFESSIONAL - Category.BBW)

    # Search for everything but BBW
    client.search(..., -Category.BBW)

Using queries
-------------

When calling :meth:`.Client.search` or any other query method, nothing is actually
fetched. Instead, a :py:class:`.Query` is created. This object is responsible for
automatically managing the requests and caches to make the query as efficient as it
can be (hopefully).

Then, all you have to do is iterate it.

.. code-block:: python

    for video in query:
        print(video.title)

For more in-depth iteration, you can use the sample method.

.. code-block:: python

    # Fetch the 10 first videos
    for video in query.sample(max = 10):
        print(video.title)
    
    # Fetch only non watched
    for video in query.sample(watched = False):
        print(video.title)

To exploit video data, see :doc:`here </features/video>`.

Using different Query types while searching
-------------------------------------------

With searching only, you can choose to use 2 different queries subclasses.
You should choose which one to use depending on what you want to do.

.. code-block:: python

    # Uses a JSONQuery (recommended) - faster and 'pornhub approved', but less data
    query = client.search(..., use_hubtraffic = True)

    # Uses a VideoQuery - slower, but fetches all of the video data
    query = client.search(..., use_hubtraffic = False)

.. note::

    To access others properties from a JSONQuery, see the warning on :doc:`Using videos </features/video>`.

Refreshing queries
------------------

As of right now, queries cannot be refreshed. Instead, you need
to initialise a new query.

.. code-block:: python

  # Check search results once every 10 min

  args = dict(
    query = 'my query',
    filter = Category.FRENCH # Or/and any filter you want
    # Other parameters if you want
  )

  while 1:

    # Initialise a new query
    query = client.search(**args)

    print(f'First result is: {query[0].title}!')

    time.sleep(60 * 10) # Wait 10 min
