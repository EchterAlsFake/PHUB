PHUB documentation
==================

PHUB is an hybrid API for Pornhub. It is able to communicate with Pornhub
using both web-scraping and wraping the Pornhub's HubTraffic API. It is
able to access most used or useful PH features, like video searching,
accessing account features, and more like video downloading.

.. warning:: PHUB is probably against PH's TOS. Use at your own risks.

.. note:: **Early dev**
    I don't have the time to maintain this often, so don't hesitate to
    contribute by submiting features requests, issues, improvements or PRs
    through the project's `github`_.
