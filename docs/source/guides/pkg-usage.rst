Package Usage
=============

Initialising a session
----------------------

First thing to do is setting up a client.
A client represents one connection to PH,
and you can use multiple at the same time.
You can also specify a custom language
locale [1]_ (``en`` by default). This will
affect searching preferences, video titles,
etc.

.. code-block:: python

    import phub

    client = phub.Client(language = 'de')

Fetching a video
----------------

If you want to work with a specific video
you know the URL of, you can initialise it
like so:

.. code-block:: python

    import phub

    client = phub.Client()

    url = 'https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=xxx'
    video = client.get(url) # (1)!

.. code-annotations::
    #.
        Note that you can also load the video 
        using the `viewkey` parameter in its URL.

        .. code-block:: python

            video = client.get('xxx')

Accessing data
--------------

A :py:class:`.Video` object has several properties you can use to fetch
data on a video. By default, no data is actually fetched until you call
a property for optimization purposes. Once fetched, data is cached for
each property. If you want to refresh the data, you will have to clear
the cache by calling :meth:`.Video.refresh`.

.. note::
  
  You can find out all the available properties
  in the :doc:`video docs </features/video>` or in the :py:class:`.Video` class.

.. code-block:: python

    video = client.get('xxx')

    print(f'The "{video.title}" has {video.likes.up} likes!')

Downloading a video
-------------------

A video can be downloaded by using :meth:`.Video.download`.

.. code-block:: python

    import phub
    from phub.locals import Quality

    client = phub.Client()
    video = client.get('xxx')

    video.download(path = 'my-video.mp4',
                   quality = Quality.BEST)

.. note::
  
  Tip: You can set the ``path`` parameter to be a directory for the video
  to be downloaded in. The file name will automatically be the video id. 

For more information on how to download, see :doc:`downloading </guides/download>`.

Logging
-------

You can use Python `logging`_ library to debug your code and see what's wrong with
it or the API.

.. _logging: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html

.. code-block:: python

    import phub
    import logging

    # Use whatever configuration you want
    logging.BasicConfig(level = logging.INFO)

    client = phub.Client()
    ...

Compatibility
-------------

Most of the PHUB objects have a ``dictify`` method that allows
them to be converted to serialized objects.

.. code-block:: python

  import phub

  client = phub.Client()
  video = client.get('xxx')

  data = video.dictify()

Result: ``{"name": "A cool video", ...}``

This is done for compatibility and ease of use with other
languages and applications, since you can easily run a small python
script or local server:

.. code-block:: python

    import phub
    import flask

    client = phub.Client()
    app = flask.Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/get')
    def get():
        try:
            url = flask.request.args.get('video')
            video = client.get(url)
            res = { 'response': video.dictify() }
        
        except Exception as err:
            res = { 'error': repr(err) }
        
        return flask.jsonify(res)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

For instance, this script will use flask to run a web server
that can fetch video data:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl <localhost>/get?video=abcdef1234
    {
        "name": "A cool video"
        # etc.
    }

Each ``dictify`` method can take as argument a :py:class:`list[str]` of keys,
if you want to avoid fetching specific things.

Below is a list of all serializable PHUB objects, along with their keys.
PHUB objects are keys that redirect to a PHUB object.

.. list-table:: Serializable objects
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Object
      - Default keys
      - PHUB objects

    * - :py:class:`.Video`
      - ``id``, ``title``, ``is_vertical``, ``duration``, ``orientation``, ``orientation``, ``views``, ``hotspots``, ``date``, ``is_free_premium``, ``is_HD``, ``is_VR``, ``embed``, ``liked``, ``watched``, ``is_favorite``
      - ``image``, ``tags``, ``likes``, ``pornstars``, ``categories``, ``author``, ``preview``
    
    * - :py:class:`.User`
      - ``name``, ``url``, ``type``, ``bio``, ``info``
      - ``avatar``

    * - :py:class:`.Image`
      - ``url``, ``name``, ``_servers``
      - /

    * - :py:class:`.Account`
      - ``name``, ``avatar``, ``is_premium``
      - ``user``
    
    * - :py:class:`.Tag`
      - ``name``, ``count``
      - /
    
    * - :py:class:`.Like`
      - ``up``, ``down``, ``ratings``
      - /
    
    * - :py:class:`.FeedItem`
      - ``user``, ``header``, ``item_type``
      - /

By default, recursive keys will appear as ``repr`` strings, unless
you allow repulsiveness with ``object.dictify(recursive = True)``.

.. warning::

  Turning on recursion can make PHUB open more requests that you might
  actually need. Make sure you specify only the keys you need when using it.

.. [1] Supported language locales are: ``cn``, ``de``, ``fr``, ``it``, ``pt``, ``pl``, ``rt``, ``nl``, ``cz``, ``jp``
